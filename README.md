# Juno's Belt
*An Asteroid settlement minigame*

Juno's Belt is a personal project for me to get a bit carried away with. I like logistics games and who better to test this out on than the folks in NCON

## Okay, but what is it?

Juno's Belt is an asteriod settlement minigame. To begin, you will sponsor a company to settle Juno's Belt. The first asteroid we will settle is Strap. After forming your company, you will have to determine your Initital Competency Kit. Strap will begin with an Administration capable of coordinating market and development activity. As we progress, with our contributions, and help from our sponsers, we can settle more asteroids.

Our current kits are...
### Initial Competency Kits (ICKs)

- **Heavy Mining**  
    Specialize in heavy mining.
    Start with more mining equipment.

- **Gastronomer**  
    Specialize in farming and food production.
    Start with the needed buildings to grow and produce food for the colony.

- **Refiner**  
    Specialize in refining metals.
    Start with a few alloy forges and a dynamics center in order to refine metals.

- **Logistics Coordinator**  
    Specialize in logistics and transportation.
    Start with a drone bay and extra warehouse space.

- **Prefab Specialist**  
    Specialize in manufacturing vital prefabs.
    Start with the factories required to make more buildings.

- **Factory Specialist**  
    Specialize in advanced manufacturing.
    Start with the factories to make components and tools.

- **Power Specialist**  
    Specialize in power generation and management.
    Start with extra power generation capacity.




## Bandwidth

In Juno's Belt, **bandwidth** is the lifeblood of your colony‚Äôs operations. Every building, from humble mining stations to advanced fabrication plants, relies on different types of bandwidth to function. Managing and trading bandwidth is key to your company‚Äôs success.

### Life Support Bandwidth üå±
Life Support bandwidth represents the systems that keep your colony habitable‚Äîair, water, temperature, and waste recycling.  Maintaining a positive balance is crucial: shortages can lead to health crises or reduced productivity, while surpluses can be traded with other settlements.

### Power Bandwidth ‚ö°
Power bandwidth represents the electrical energy required to keep your facilities running. Most buildings consume power bandwidth, while some‚Äîlike solar arrays and headquarters‚Äîcan generate it. Balancing your power grid is essential: too little, and your operations grind to a halt; too much, and you can export the surplus to other companies for profit.

### Logistics Bandwidth üì¶
Logistics bandwidth is the backbone of your supply chains. It covers the movement of goods, materials, and information between buildings. Warehouses, drone bays, and logistics centers all play a role in generating or consuming logistics bandwidth. Efficient logistics mean faster production, better resource allocation, and a thriving settlement.

### Security Bandwidth üõ°Ô∏è
As your colony grows, so does the risk of crime and unrest. Security bandwidth is needed to maintain order and protect your assets. Security outposts, police drones, and trained personnel all contribute to your security bandwidth. Neglecting security can lead to disruptions, theft, or worse‚Äîso keep your defenses strong!

**Tip:** Bandwidth isn‚Äôt just for internal use. You can export excess bandwidth to other companies, forging alliances or earning valuable resources in return. Mastering bandwidth management is the key to thriving in Juno‚Äôs Belt!


## Administration

Every asteroid settlement is anchored by an **Administration**‚Äîthe heart of domestic operations and the engine of market activity. At first, Administration offers only basic amenities and limited capacity. To unlock its full potential, companies must invest and collaborate, expanding Administration‚Äôs reach and capabilities over time.

### The Market

Profit drives every company, but survival demands cooperation. No one thrives alone in Juno‚Äôs Belt. The Administration operates a central marketplace where colonists can trade both tangible goods and vital bandwidth, ensuring everyone has a shot at success.

#### Commodities

**Commodities** are physical goods‚Äîminerals, food, tools, and more‚Äîthat can be bought and sold. All commodities must be stored at the Administration, and storage space is always at a premium. Smart trading and careful inventory management are essential for growth.

#### Bandwidth

**Bandwidth** is less tangible but just as valuable. Unlike commodities, bandwidth isn‚Äôt stored at Administration. Instead, companies negotiate contracts to import or export surplus bandwidth, forging alliances and fueling each other‚Äôs operations. Mastering bandwidth trading is key to outpacing the competition and keeping your colony running smoothly.
